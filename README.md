# Linux-Shell Basic Commands           

### Below are the commands that are documented by me and will be updating.

---

- `touch `
  
  (Create empty files or update file timestamps.Mostly used in Automations)

 
- `ls`
  
  (List files or List directory contents)

 
- `ls -ltr`
  
  (Lists the files with dates or lists files in long format sorted by time, with the latest files at the bottom)

 
-  `man ls`

   (Manual for Linux)

 
- `vim`
  
  (Command-line text editor in Linux used for editing files)
  
  `vi`
  
  (Editing files, By default available in Linux)

 
- `#!/bin/bash`
  ```
  #! - Shebag 
  
  Where bash, dash, ksh and sh are called executables 
   
  bash is commonly used 
   
  Earlier there was a soft link between #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/bash 
   
  Now in ubuntu there is a soft link between #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/dash 
  ```


- `echo "Test"`
  
    (Print message or display text or variables in the terminal)


-  `sh script.sh` or `./script.sh`

    (To execute the script shell file)

  
- `cat`

  (Display the contents of a file in the terminal)

  
- `chmod`
  
  (ch- change, Change file permissions)

```  
  -   User
  -   Group 
  -   Other   
 
   `chmod 777 <file-name>`
 
   4-Read | 2-Write | 1-Execute 
```


- `history`

  (Shows a list of previously executed commands in the terminal)

 
- `pwd`

  (Displays the current working directory (path))


- `cd`

  (Change the current working directory)

 
- `mkdir`

  (Create a new directory)

  
- `nproc`
  
  (Displays the number of available processing units (CPU cores)) 

  
- `free` 

  (Shows the system's memory usage and available memory)

  
- `top` 

  (Provides real-time system monitoring, displaying information about processes and system usage)

 
- `df`
  
  (Displays information about disk space usage on file systems) 

  
- `ps -ef` 

  (Lists all running processes in full format in Linux)  

  
- `ps -ef | grep "amazon"`  

  (Lists processes containing the string "amazon" using the "grep" command to filter the output)


- `awk` 

  (It is a versatile text-processing tool used in Linux for extracting and manipulating data in structured text files)


- `ps -ef | grep "amazon" | awk -F" " '{print $2}'`

  (Extracts the second column (process IDs) of processes containing "amazon" using the "awk" command after filtering with "grep.")

 
- `set -x` 

  (In debug mode) 


- `date`

  (Displays the current date and time)

  (Date sends the output to stdin, hence using `|` doesn't re-direct the output of first command to the second command)

  (See the below command for example)


- `date | echo "test"`

  (The command "date | echo "test"" will just output "test" without including the output of the "date" command)


- `curl -x GET api.foo.com`

  (Gives output of info provided by API of foo.com)
 

- `curl https://github.com/Pavan-1997/Linux-Shell_Basics_Commands/blob/main/dummylog01122022.log | grep ERROR` 

  (Transfers data to or from a server using various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or Retrieves information from the above URL, and gives only the ERROR logs)
 

- `wget https://github.com/Pavan-1997/Linux-Shell_Basics_Commands/blob/main/dummylog01122022.log`

  (Download files from the internet using various protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP or Using the above we can't view the info but downloads the file)  

   
- `sudo su -`  

  (Switch to the root user)

 
- `sudo find / -name pavan`

   (Searches the entire filesystem for files or directories named "pavan," with elevated privileges using "sudo" to access restricted areas)

 ---
 ### Loops:
  
```
a=4 
b=10 
 
if [$a > $b] 
then  
    echo "a is greater than b" 
else 
    echo "b is greater than a" 
fi 
```


```
for i in {1.100}; do echo $1; done
```

---
### Trap & Kill:

- `trap "echo donâ€™t use the Ctrl+c" SIGINT` 

  (Trapping signals, even when if they send a Ctrl + C signal they get the above echo message)
 
- `trap "rm -rf *" SIGINT` 

  (Delete everything from the database when hitting Ctrl + C)
 
- `kill -9 1111` 

  (Pass a kill signal to Linux to terminate 1111 process ID)
